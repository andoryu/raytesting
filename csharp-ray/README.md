# Ray Tracing a Weekend - C# #

Manky translation of the original C++ to C# to fiddle with ray tracing.

## Notes ##
Seems to run a slow as a wet weekend. 

Some future opportunities for enhancement. Guessing that all the object/struct creation/destruction has a part to play. Need to find the reference to raytracing optimisation on Python using NumPy.

## Progress ##
**Up to section 8.24 Lambertian Reflection**
